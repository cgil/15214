If you have decided to complete hw9 with your own Facelook interface, you can safely ignore this file. Otherwise, read on.

This file contains basic guidelines to help you get started if you have decided to work with the staff provided interface as opposed to your own.

Most of the functionality of Facelook has been implemented in our interface, the exception being any interfaces dependent on information from the backend (e.g. the list of status posts). 

The following have spaces for you to fill in your own code to communicate with your backend. They are marked off by //TODO comments in each of the files.
